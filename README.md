## Hacktoberfest 2025: Contribution Rules üìú

To earn your Hacktoberfest reward, follow these simple rules:

1. **Register for Hacktoberfest** and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between **October 1 and 31** (any time zone).
2. PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, but only those with the **Hacktoberfest** label will count.
3. **Quality over quantity**: Spammy or low-quality PRs will be marked as such and may result in disqualification. Adhere to the project‚Äôs code of conduct to stay eligible.
4. **Write your own code**: Repeated algorithms will not be merged.

## Your Contributions üì¶

Here's what you need to include in your PRs:

1. **Problem Statement**  
   - Clearly describe the problem you are solving.  
   - Keep it short and precise.

2. **Your Code**  
   - Provide a clean and well-commented solution.  
   - At the top of every code file, please include:
     - Problem Statement
     - Time Complexity
     - Space Complexity
     - output

   **Example (inside your `.py` / `.js` / `.cpp` file):**
   ```python
   # Problem Statement: Print "Hello Hacktoberfest" N times
   # Time Complexity: O(N)
   # Space Complexity: O(1)

   def hello(n):
       for i in range(n):
           print("Hello Hacktoberfest")

   hello(3)

# Output:
Hello Hacktoberfest
Hello Hacktoberfest
Hello Hacktoberfest
