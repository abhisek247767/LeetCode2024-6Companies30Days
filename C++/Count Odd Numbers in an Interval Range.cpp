/*
Problem Statement:
1523. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range
Given two non - negative integers low and high.Return the count of odd numbers between low and high(inclusive).

Example 1:

Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output : 3
Explanation : The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are[3, 5, 7].
Example 2 :

	Input : low = 8, high = 10
	Output : 1
	Explanation : The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are[9].
