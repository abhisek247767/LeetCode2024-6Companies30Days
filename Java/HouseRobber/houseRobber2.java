package Java.HouseRobber;

// You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

// Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [2,3,2]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
// Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
